# Writeups

Hello.

If you're looking for writeup that goes straight to the point, this may not be it.

If you're looking for stories, failures, and hope, you may find what you're looking for.

I believe having a story of how people are thinking while trying to solve challenges and problems is as valuable as the solution itself. Maybe that rabbit hole wasn't useful today, but it may be tomorrow.

In any case, I hope you'll enjoy the read.
